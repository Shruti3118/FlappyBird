## Description

Flappy Bird is a simple yet challenging arcade game where the player controls a bird trying to navigate through a series of pipes. The goal is to keep the bird from hitting the pipes and the ground by pressing spacebar to make it fly. The game becomes increasingly difficult as the bird progresses. The score increases every time the bird successfully passes through a set of pipes.

The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or falls to the ground.
